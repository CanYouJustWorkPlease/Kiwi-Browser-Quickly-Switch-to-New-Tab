# Kiwi Browser Quickly Switch to New Tab

It works with Kiwi Browser 124.0.6327.4

It may not work with older Kiwi Browser versions. I know for sure there was an older Kiwi Browser version that it didn't work with. So, make sure to update to the latest Kiwi Browser.

1. Download Kiwi Browser Quickly Switch to New Tab extension from [here](https://github.com/CanYouJustWorkPlease/Kiwi-Browser-Quickly-Switch-to-New-Tab/releases/download/v1.0/Kiwi.BrowserQuickly.Switch.to.New.Tab.zip)
