# Kiwi Browser Quickly Switch to New Tab

It works with Kiwi Browser 124.0.6327.4

It may not work with older Kiwi Browser versions. I know for sure there was an older Kiwi Browser version that it didn't work with. So, make sure to update to the latest Kiwi Browser.

Guide on how to use this:

1. Download Kiwi Browser Quickly Switch to New Tab extension from [here](https://github.com/CanYouJustWorkPlease/Kiwi-Browser-Quickly-Switch-to-New-Tab/releases/download/v1.0/Kiwi.BrowserQuickly.Switch.to.New.Tab.zip)
2. Open Kiwi Browser and tap the 3 dots at the top right corner, and tap Extensions
3. Enable `Developer mode`
4. From the top of the page tap `+(from .zip/.crx/.user.js)`
5. Now from Downloads pick `Kiwi.BrowserQuickly.Switch.to.New.Tab.zip`
6. This is how it should work now:

**ISSUES FIXING**:

As a temporary fix, if the button doesn't show up at the bottom of the page, and if you're using Ublock Origin, make sure to open up Ublock Origin and disable `Cosmetic filtering` for the current site, and refresh the page:
